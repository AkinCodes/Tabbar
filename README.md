# Tabbar
I am titling the project as Tabbar project. This project is to showcase the functionality of tabbars and how clicking on each one will open up a View/Page of its own. Also there is a pop up page that appears when one of the tabs is pressed which can can be dismissed when the button on that page is tapped.  I have used distinctive colours on each View Page to uniquely identify each view from the other giving the look and feel of separate pages when tabs are tapped. Enjoy.
